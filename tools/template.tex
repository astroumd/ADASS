\section{Introduction}

Your abstract currently has ${LENA} characters. For more than 1000 it's probably too long. Just sayin'
Since this paper was written by some python code, you better edit this rubbish away.


\section{The Template}

To use this template instead of the ADASS\_template, copy this file to your given paper, e.g. O3.1.tex, P5.2.tex, B4.tex, F3.tex, I.tex, place the
paper type in the Makefile, review the Makefile, and hit ``make'' and hope for the best.  If that runs into trouble, check if your version of
latex uses a different calling sequence.  Some instructions are in the Makefile.

\section{Figures}

This template has no figures.
Look for the larger template and Makefile how to do this.

\section{References}

This template has no bibtex file. 
Look for the larger template and Makefile how to do this.
