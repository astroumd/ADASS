\section{Introduction}

Your abstract currently has ${LENA} characters. For more than 1000 it's possibly too long. Just sayin'
Since this paper was written by some python code, ignore that warning, but better edit most of this rubbish away.


\section{The Template}

To use this 2018 template instead of the ADASS\_template, copy this file to your given paper,
e.g. O3-1.tex, P5-2.tex, B4.tex, F3.tex, I2-1.tex, place the
paper type in the Makefile, review the Makefile, and hit ``make'' and hope for the best.
If that runs into trouble, check if your version of
latex uses a different calling sequence.  Some instructions are in the Makefile.
The Makefile also orchestrates putting the correct (and no more) files in the tar or zip file.

\section{Figures}

This template has no figures.
Look for the larger template and Makefile how to do this.

\section{References}

This template has no bibtex file. 
Look for the larger template and Makefile how to do this. By default the Makefile will create
an empty ${PCODE}.bib. When you add references to this, uncomment  the 
line \verb+% \bibliography+  below, then use ``make'' to
create your beautifully looking PDF.

% \bibliography{${PCODE}}
