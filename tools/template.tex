\section{Introduction}

Your abstract currently has ${LENA} characters. For more than 1000
it's possibly too long. Just sayin' Since this paper was written by
some python code, ignore that warning, since you will edit most of
this rubbish away for your final version.


\section{This Template}

To use this 2018 template instead of the ADASS\_template, copy this
file (named something like O3-1.tex, P5-2.tex, B4.tex, F3.tex, T1.tex, or
I2-1.tex) in your local ADASS2018\_author\_template directory (where you also find the
asp2014.sty, the Makefile etc).  Edit the macros in the {\tt makedef} file, and
hit ``{\tt make}'' and hope for the best.  If that runs into trouble, check
if your version of latex uses a different calling sequence.  Some
instructions are in the Makefile. When you send your tar file, it's useful
to send the {\tt makedefs} file along.

\section{Figures}

This template has no figures.  Look for the larger template and
Makefile how to do this.

\section{References}

This template has no bibtex file.  Look for the larger template and
Makefile how to do this. By default the {\tt Makefile} will create an empty
${PCODE}.bib. When you add references to this, uncomment the line
\verb+\bibliography+ below, make use ``{\tt make pdf}'' to create your
beautifully looking PDF, and ``{\tt make check}'' to check if you can make
life for the ADASS editors a little easier. Pretty Please.
